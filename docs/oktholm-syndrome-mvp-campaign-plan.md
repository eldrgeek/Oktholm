# Oktholm Syndrome MVP Campaign Project Plan

**Overview:** This project will launch **Oktholm Syndrome**, a satirical, absurd fictional syndrome that parodies wellness culture and corporate mental health initiatives using pseudo-scientific language and surreal humor. The MVP includes a hybrid static/interactive **website**, a seeded **Reddit community** (primary hub), **support channels** on LinkedIn, Discord, and Slack, and a suite of **absurd media assets** (images, videos) to drive engagement. All content will blend a **sterile corporate medical** feel with bizarre **1990s/vaporwave** aesthetics for a funny yet professional tone. We recommend securing a memorable domain (e.g. **OktholmSyndrome.com**) to anchor the campaign. Below is a prioritized plan with tasks, required content, AI generation prompts, and step-by-step instructions for implementation.

## Task 1: Branding & Domain Setup

- **What to Build:** Establish the campaign's identity and online presence. Secure a domain and create the Oktholm Syndrome "brand" – including name usage, logo/icon, tagline, and style guidelines. Define the absurdist-yet-corporate visual style (e.g. clinical blues/greys with neon vaporwave accents) and voice (over-the-top empathetic HR tone mixed with surreal humor).

- **Fictional Content & Story Elements:** Coin a tongue-in-cheek **tagline** (e.g. *"Recovering from Identity Provider Captivity, Together."*). Optionally devise a fake backstory for the syndrome's name (perhaps attributed to a fictional Dr. Oktholm or an "Institute of Corporate Trauma"). This adds lore without overtly mentioning any real company. Prepare a brief **brand style guide** (color palette, fonts reminiscent of medical brochures, and glitchy 90s graphics).

- **Media Prompt (Logo/Branding):** *"Design a fake corporate wellness logo for **Oktholm Syndrome Recovery** – mimic a bland healthcare logo (calm blue/green tones, simple sans-serif text) but twist it with a subtle surreal element (e.g. a heart or medical cross **morphing into a broken padlock** to symbolize 'loving your captor')."*

- **Automation Steps:**
  1. **Domain Registration:** Use a domain search tool to check availability of **OktholmSyndrome.com** (or a witty alternative like **OktholmRecovery.org**). If available, register the domain.
  2. **Brand Assets:** Generate the **logo** using an AI image tool with the prompt above. Iterate as needed until you have a clean, professional-looking logo that on closer inspection has a quirky detail. Save the logo (favicon size and high-res).
  3. **Brand Guide:** Document the color scheme (e.g. white background, navy text for corporate feel, plus a neon pink or teal accent for vaporwave vibe). Choose a primary font (e.g. a sterile Helvetica or Open Sans) and maybe a secondary "90s" display font for accents.
  4. **Tagline & Messaging:** Confirm the tagline and a short blurb describing Oktholm Syndrome in a pseudo-clinical way (for use on website metadata and social profiles). For example: *"Oktholm Syndrome is the condition of loving the tech that hurts you – join us in recovery with humor and hope."*
  5. **Prepare for Site Build:** Create a basic coming-soon page or repository using the domain – include the logo, tagline, and a "Stay tuned" message. This tests the domain setup and introduces the branding while the full site is in development.

## Task 2: Website Content & UI Design

- **What to Build:** Develop a **landing website** that introduces Oktholm Syndrome with a mix of static informational sections and a playful corporate-medical UI. The site should feel like an official wellness program page that's *just a bit off*. Organize content into digestible sections (e.g. **"What is Oktholm Syndrome?"**, **"Symptoms & Signs,"** **"Recovery & Support"**, **"Testimonials,"** and **"Take the Assessment"**). Emphasize an absurdly sincere tone – the site should initially look legitimate and professional, then delight visitors with its surreal, satirical details.
