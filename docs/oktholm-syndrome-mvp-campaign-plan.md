# Oktholm Campaign MVP Project Plan

## Objective & Concept Overview

The **Oktholm Syndrome** campaign is a satirical, humorous initiative inspired by "Stockholm syndrome" – except the captor is Okta (the login platform)! The goal is to playfully highlight how users remain *loyal to Okta despite its quirks and frustrations*. This MVP will center on a simple website (a one-page “campaign hub”) with engaging comedic content and easy ways for visitors to share or join the fun. We will incorporate **absurd humor** and **relatable tech frustrations** to encourage social sharing and community engagement. The campaign content will cover **all forms** – text, images, video script, etc. – giving **equal weight** to each for maximum viral potential.

**Key MVP outcome:** A live website (with a memorable dot-com URL) that introduces Oktholm Syndrome and showcases humorous content (memes, a faux infographic, satirical copy, etc.), plus integration with social media (share buttons, links to community pages). This plan is organized by priority, detailing each task the team/LLM should perform, along with information needed to execute them.
