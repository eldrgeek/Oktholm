## Scoring System & Results

### Score Calculation
```javascript
const calculateAssessmentLevel = (totalScore) => {
  if (totalScore <= 10) return 'healthy';
  if (totalScore <= 20) return 'early';
  if (totalScore <= 30) return 'moderate';
  return 'severe';
};

const getScoreDescription = (score, level) => {
  return {
    score,
    level,
    percentage: Math.round((score / 40) * 100),
    description: getDescriptionByLevel(level),
    recommendations: getRecommendationsByLevel(level)
  };
};
```

### Results by Level

#### Healthy Relationship (0-10 points)
**Title**: "Healthy Technology Relationship"
**Description**: 
```
Congratulations! You maintain a healthy, professional relationship with your technology stack. You recognize problems for what they are and approach solutions pragmatically. 

You're either very fortunate with your software choices, haven't been in IT long enough to develop dependency symptoms, or you have excellent boundary-setting skills with technology.
```
**Recommendations**:
- Consider mentoring colleagues who may be struggling
- Share your healthy approaches with the community
- Help identify early warning signs in your organization
- Document best practices for technology evaluation

**Next Steps**:
- Join our community as a mentor/guide
- Share your success strategies
- Help others recognize healthy patterns

#### Early Symptoms (11-20 points)
**Title**: "Early Stage Oktholm Syndrome"
**Description**:
```
You're showing early warning signs of Oktholm Syndrome. You've begun rationalizing some problematic software behaviors and may experience mild anxiety about system changes.

The good news is that early intervention can prevent progression to chronic dependency. Recognition of these patterns is the first step toward maintaining healthy technology relationships.
```
**Recommendations**:
- Start documenting actual system problems vs. workarounds
- Research alternative solutions while symptoms are mild
- Connect with others who've maintained healthy boundaries
- Practice saying "this is a system problem" instead of blaming yourself

**Next Steps**:
- Join our early intervention support group
- Take the advanced assessment in 3 months
- Begin the vendor relationship evaluation process

#### Moderate Syndrome (21-30 points)
**Title**: "Moderate Oktholm Syndrome"
**Description**:
```
You have moderate Oktholm Syndrome. You've developed significant emotional attachment to problematic software and actively defend systems that harm your productivity.

You may experience anxiety about change and have created elaborate workarounds that you've begun to see as features rather than symptoms. Recovery is absolutely possible with proper support.
```
**Recommendations**:
- Acknowledge that your workarounds indicate system problems
- Begin gradual exposure to alternative solutions
- Join a support group with others at similar stages
- Practice differentiating between system problems and user error

**Next Steps**:
- Weekly support group participation recommended
- Begin documenting daily syndrome impacts
- Start alternative solution research with community support

#### Severe Syndrome (31-40 points)
**Title**: "Severe Oktholm Syndrome"
**Description**:
```
You have severe Oktholm Syndrome. You may be experiencing complete emotional dependency on dysfunctional software, defending it against all criticism, and potentially training others in your dependency patterns.

This level requires intensive community support and structured recovery planning. Many people have successfully recovered from this stage with proper guidance and peer support.
```
**Recommendations**:
- Immediate community support group participation
- Consider that your "expertise" may be trauma response patterns
- Begin recovery journal to track daily impacts
- Connect with others who've recovered from severe stages

**Next Steps**:
- Daily community check-ins recommended
- Structured recovery program participation
- Mentor assignment from recovery alumni
- Monthly progress assessments
