# Task 01-03: Logo Design & Visual Identity

## Objective
Create a distinctive logo and visual identity system for Oktholm Syndrome that balances medical professionalism with subtle digital/glitch aesthetics

## Deliverable
Logo designs, color palette, typography guidelines, and design system documentation

## Status

- Medical blue palette with digital red accents

### Alternative Concepts
1. **Stethoscope + USB Cable**: Medical tool merged with tech connector
2. **Heart Rate Monitor with Error**: EKG line that glitches into error pattern
3. **Support Group Circle**: Ring of abstract figures with one highlighted
4. **Shield with Vulnerability**: Security badge with deliberately broken element
