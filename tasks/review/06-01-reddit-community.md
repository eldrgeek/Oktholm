Content Type: Educational/Satirical
Flair: Medical Journal

Post Content:
**Abstract:** 
This study examines the prevalence and severity of authentication fatigue among IT professionals, with particular focus on the development of Stockholm Syndrome-like attachment patterns to problematic identity management systems.

**Key Findings:**
‚Ä¢ 73% of IT professionals report defending systems they privately complain about
‚Ä¢ Average daily authentication attempts: 47 (range: 12-156)
‚Ä¢ 89% have created workarounds they now consider "features"
‚Ä¢ Syndrome severity correlates with years of exposure and system complexity

**Clinical Observations:**
Patients often present with phrases like "once you learn the quirks, it's actually really good" and "the new system would require too much retraining."

**Treatment Recommendations:**
‚Ä¢ Recognition of symptoms (community support)
‚Ä¢ Gradual exposure to alternative solutions
‚Ä¢ Peer support groups (r/OktholmSyndrome)
‚Ä¢ Boundary setting with vendor relationships
